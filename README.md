GRIP-TSF repository contains all the tasks done as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation.

Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML. The objective was to predict the percentage of student based on the number of the study hours using simple linear regression algorithm.

Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML. The objective was to predict the optimum number of clusters using 'The Elbow method' and formed clusters using K-Means algorithm and visualized it.

Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree.The objective was to create a decision tree, visualize it graphically and if the new data is fed to the classifier, it should be able to predict the right class accordingly.
